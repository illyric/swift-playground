Swift is a type-safe language
Types can be explicitly annotated, or infered by initial value
var - variable
let - constant - good practise to use
Conversion of types is ALWAYS explicit
Example:
  var score = 1         //infered as Int
  val highScore = 100.0 // infered as Double

  //later
  highScore = score     //will not work! You can't assign an Int value to Double

In order to fix, you need to explicitly convert the Int to a Double value
  highScore = Double(score)
