- Swift is a type-safe language
- Statements do not end with ;
- Variables and constants are never automatically initialized to default values (as they are common in different languages)
- Types can be explicitly annotated, or infered by initial value
- "var" - variable keyword
- "let" - constant keyword - good practise to use

- Conversion of types is ALWAYS explicit
- Example:
    var score = 1         //infered as Int
    val highScore = 100.0 // infered as Double

    //later
    highScore = score     //will not work! You can't assign an Int value to Double

In order to fix, you need to explicitly convert the Int to a Double value
    highScore = Double(score)

- The "Optional" operator ? is used when we don't have inital values for a variable

    var firstName: String
    var middleName: String?      // ? meaning, middleName is optional value
    var lastName: String
    var email: String
    var secondaryEmail: String?  //? user might not have a secondary email
